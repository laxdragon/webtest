# CodeWeavers PHP Web Test

The point of this test is to test your JS and PHP skills. There are
some flaws with this simple form in both the JS and on the client
side PHP.

This form should be able to submit the form data, append to a CSV file,
and display a successful page after completion.

Create a git diff patch of your changes and email them back to us to
complete the test.

To create the sqlite3 database do the following
```
cat include/tables.sql | sqlite3 data/data.db
```
